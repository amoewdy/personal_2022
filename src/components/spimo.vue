                            Child Asthma Management Toolkit is an IoT solution that helps school-aged children with asthma to have better control over their health, foster an asthma management habit, improve their quality of life, and reduce their parent’s burden of responsibility.

                <h4>KEY FINDINGS</h4>
                <p>
                    1. Asthma is a serious problem for school-aged children. More than 26 million Americans have asthma, including 6 million children. It is the top reason for missed school days.
                    <br><br>2. Children’s voice is missing in the current market space. Most products on the market focus on the monitor of serious attack or automated detection of a certain symptom.
                    <br><br>3. A children-friendly product should be safe, robust, and emotionally appealing. Children are more likely to act irrationally than adults. Their cooperation is based on emotional connections.
                    <br><br>4. A shared asthma management solution would <b>rely on the children to report symptoms</b>. Parents can‘t track their child all day. School-aged children want to be the primary person responsible for their asthma care management.
                    <br><br>5. Children <b>tend to lie when they don’t want parents to make a fuss about something</b>. Children are more likely to lie when they know they didn’t do as expected, such as brushing their teeth every day, and believe they can handle the consequences without being blamed by parents.
                    <br><br>6. The uncontrollable attack of asthma on children is partly due to the lack of asthma management. There can be <b>trends in the frequency and severity of symptoms</b>. In order to prevent the child’s asthma from influencing their daily life and activities, they need to do well in <b>taking daily medicine and recording the symptoms</b> in busy daily life.

                    1. Children tend to lie to their parents about their symptoms

                <p>
                    With the findings, we came to a concept that includes a wearable, an upload device, and a web app. The central idea of this concept is to transfer the responsibility of managing asthma from parents to children and help them to self-report symptoms.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h4>Why there should be an upload device?</h4>
                <p>
                    The above concept is based on several assumptions which we will validate through further user research later.

                    <b>Asynchronous data transfer might help avoid lying</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While real-time data is nice for parents to view, it might cause privacy issues and children’s resistance. When the children are trusted to have full control of the wearable device, they would be more likely to wear it and use it properly since they know their symptom report would not make their parents worried instantly.

                    ✓ User Dependence on Health Tracking Product 
                    <br>Most users developed the habit of daily data checking (right after getting up or when they are free) after a few months.
                    <br>
                    <br>✓ Interaction Gesture
                    <br>Single tap and long press are two commonly used gestures on the smart band.
                    <br>
                    <br>✓ Parents’ acceptance of wearable devices
                    <br>Parents with children already using wearable device have a higher acceptance of the always-connected device. However, most parents are worried that a wearable device (especially a smartwatch) would be a great distraction at school.

                More quantitative analysis was necessary before we release the product to end users. As we implemented the web app and cloud server, we conducted 2 rounds of remote usability testing online through UserTesting.com separated by two weeks. We used the exact tasks, questions, and surveys so as to compare the user sentiments, key performance indicators, etc. to see how effective we have iterated based on users’ feedback.
                <br>
                <br>To reduce variables, we populated some demo data into the database and create a demo account. All users were asked to use the same account, view the same data, and perform the same tasks.

                    This time we conducted detailed but concise in-home usability testing against real end-users which are families consisting of parents and children with asthma. Such testing would help us find out the last-minute feature-agnostic issues that reduce product stability and usability.
                    <br>
                    <br>The goal of this user evaluation is to 
                    <br>1) validate the feasibility of the system 
                    <br>2) find usability issues before we deliver the devices.
                    <br>
                    <br>Instead of the typical process which requires users to read aloud the task items, we have designed and printed <b>user manuals</b> and put them inside the product box. The users were supposed to follow the instructions on the user manual step by step.

                <p>
                    From the contextual inquiry and observation session, we collected some confirmative feedbacks which proves the feasibility of the solution.
                    <br>
                    <br>✓ Children are willing to wear a watch-like wearable to school.
                    <br>✓ Parents believe that the children are more likely to report their symptom to a device than to then directly.
                    <br>✓ Parents can explain the usage of the watch clearly to their children.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, there are some usability issues that might reduce the reliability of the system, as well as some unexpected findings.
                    <br><br>• Single reliance on the user manual is dangerous
                    <br>• Solution efficacy may be compromised due to the design of the watch
                    <br>• The upload device should be easily visible at home in the open area
