                        <h1>HEMA-GO Fresh</h1>
                        <p><br>HEMA Fresh is a pioneer of new retailing, based on a combination of online and offline experiences. 
                        The offline shops help to increase the customer’s frequency of ordering online as they can view the 
                        quality of products in store, and the online application helps as a platform to know about the news 
                        for the offline shops and to easily order food for home delivery. The shop focuses on fresh seafood 
                        to drive its sales. Under this kind of business model, the goal of HEMA is to increase sales in the 
                        online application, and in the meanwhile, to get higher shares in the food market.<br><br>

                        In relation to HEMA’s current goal, we undertook an iterative design process to generate 
                        more online sales for HEMA. We analyzed target customers and the existing market situation, 
                        as well as building a multi-stakeholder business model around our final concept proposal.</p>

                            HEMA to buy high quality seafood, but she hesistates about the quality 
                            and delivery of food through online ordering. When Zheng visits HEMA’s 
                            store once a month, she is frustrated by the queues and carrying heavy 
                            grocery bags home. She also finds it tedious to search for diverse reci
                            pes that her family can enjoy.<br>
                            How can design to reduce Zheng’s worries and make shopping in HEMA a pleasurable part of her daily life?

                    In a discussion with one of HEMA’s employees, our group picked up on some areas which we could work on.
                    <br>First, the store was getting more popular amongst local chinese for its seafood cuisine. An increase in awareness of Hema’s brand could lead to even more customers coming to its store. Without dealing with this issue, the future experience of customers might not be as favourable. Hence, we wanted to improve on the store’s payment process.
                    <br>Second, greater numbers of visitors to the physical store are not translating into greater amounts of online sales. Customers might be unaware of Hema’s online presence and treat it as another restaurant concept. The creation of a mobile application that is meant to be used both in the store and outside could help to bridge the gap between the online and offline environment.

                    She then walks towards the counter and scans the fish with her phone. The image recognition technology recognises the type of fish and displays it on her phone.<br>
                    Zheng continues walking along the store shelves and spots a nice tin of tea. She wants to purchase it and scans the tea with her phone. As she shakes the phone, the tea is automatically placed into her virtual shopping cart.<br>

                <h4>Concept Value</h4>
                <p>
                    At the core of our concept, there is a drive by the need to increase online sales through the improvement of the offline store experience. HEMA’s physical stores are popular amongst young-crowds mainly for the fresh seafood. Our objective is to link users to the online application while in the physical store.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                Usage of our online application within the store does two things:<br>
                <b>1. Familarity<br></b>
                Users are encouraged to use the online application even when they are not physically at the store as they are more familiar with it.<br>
                <b>2. Trust<br></b>
                Users are more trusting of the quality of HEMA’s products even when online since the connection to viewing products online within the store, where they currently trust the quality, is triggered.<br>
                </p>
                <div class="image-middle-container" style='margin:30px'>
                            <img src="/static/hema/10.png" width="60%" >
                </div>
                <p>
                    To improve the offline–online experience, our concept involves 3 strategies:<br>
                    - First, an application is created which allows users to pay in the store without needing to check-out at a physical counter. This improves the seamlessness of the in-store experience, addressing the issue of crowdedness. In addition, it conditions users to make payments through our app. This means that there is less inertia to using our application even when they are at home.<br>
                    - Second, our application will track our users’ product history and movement throughout the store. From this, we will be better able to determine our users’ preferences for certain foods as a form of data collection. We can then tailor future recommendations towards a specific user, thereby further improving their experience at HEMA through personalization and tailoring.<br>
                    - Third, our application will be equipped with image recognition technology that allows it to recognize Hema’s products. Users will be able to determine the nutritional information of categories of food within the store. On top of that, details such as the place of origin of the food can be displayed to the consumer. Again, this helps to improve the overall experience of the physical store.<br>

                    With investment from Alibaba, we would gain the resources to start up our application and give additional publicity for HEMA. In this instance, Alibaba will provide their data collection expertise for our business which would likely be expensive for HEMA. Money provided by Alibaba will allow us to hire external chefs for recipe creation. In addition, we will be able to hire application developers to improve the online payments process.<br><br>
                    As can be seen under our revenue streams, the sale of seafood forms a small part of the profits. A greater influence on the bottom line can be attributed to the sale of complementary ingredients to the sale of seafood. This is a good validation for us to focus on the ease with which consumers should be able to buy the accompanying ingredients for their selected choice of seafood.<br><br>
                    A big part of our costs can be mitigated through our partnership with Alibaba, such as big data analysis and application development. However, HEMA would still have to spend money on the redesigning their store layout to make it more suitable for coherent use with our online application (removing cashier counters, for example).<br><br>
                    The motivation matrix (right) highlights the key stakeholders involvement. It also provides examples of how to enlist the help of partners by discovering how their benefits and gains for the business. The motivation matrix shows that both Alibaba and HEMA stand to gain from a partnership with one another within our business proposal, therefore strengthening it’s feasibility.<br>

                        From the interviews, in combination with additional online research, it became evident that people between the age of 25-35 who are middle-upper class like to shop at HEMA Fresh Seafood, because they have the financial capability, enjoy quality and are open to new things. We discovered, more specially, that for all the interviewees, they would like to enhance their shopping efficiency via the process.<br>

                <p>
                As our main design innovation revolves around the mobile application, our group has tried to implement as many persuasive principles into the user interface design as possible.<br>
                Such principles include:<br>
                1. Tailoring & Personalisation of recipes. Based on the users’ movements through the store while using the application, we can track what categories of food products they would tend to move towards.<br>
                2. Suggestion. An understanding of a user’s taste will allow us to create recommendations of food products to buy. <br>
                3. Reduction. Instead of carrying their food products to the cashier to check out, our mobile application allows for users to purchase their products immediately with the shake of their phone screen. This makes things easier than going through the multi-step process of typical online purchases.  <br>

                    By analyzing HEMA’s direct competitors, we gained an understanding from our own perspective about HEMA’s key features and market strategy.<br>
                    <b>- Brand building<br></b>
                    HEMA builds its brand with an exquisite offline store, food with good quality and convenient delivery within 30 minutes.<br>
                    <b>- Very wide range & Low degree of openness<br></b>
                    HEMA’s ambition is that their customers buy all components for a meal from them. HEMA has a closed system to some extent, just like Apple, and they want to provide all the fresh groceries you need so they can replace ordinary supermarkets. Once customers buy everything they need in HEMA and they trust HEMA’s service and quality, they can form the habit of doing their entire daily shopping at HEMA.<br>

                <p>
                    Our orginial concept involved using real-time pictures of Hema’s products to consumers as a display of quality. This concept was based on the idea that our users determined the freshness of the goods by the color of the leaves and the fruit. This meant that the physical appearance of the product had a big role in influencing our consumers’ decisions.
                    <br>Also, we wanted to create simple but inspiring recipes to our target market group who we believed had sub-optimal cooking skills. This is because the practice of cooking amongst the younger generations of chinese tend to be less prevalent.
                    <br>After taking into consideration HEMA’s approach, we made significant changes to our final concept. In essence, we have improved on the ways in which we can create tailored recipe recommendations to improve the experience of Hema’s brand. In addition, we found an effective method which can create more offline-online convertions while also reducing overcrowding at Hema’s stores.

                    According to the exposure-effect theory people tend to be prefer things that are most familiar to them. Greater time spent on our application triggers customers to use the app automatically while they are at home. Encouraging the use of the online app during their offline experience is critical in ensuring the offline to online transition.

                <h4>Key Takeaways for HEMA</h4>  
                <p>
                The use of the physical stores to promote its online goods is a valuable tool. It helps to build trust in HEMA’s brand. However, the high costs of real estate means that HEMA would have to create a more efficient in-store environment to respond to the increasing visitor numbers. Overcrowding could negatively affect customers’ experience of the store.
                <br>The use of an online payments system could help to reduce waiting times and improve revenue at the store. Also, it familiarises customers with the online payment environment of HEMA. This would make them more willing to buy groceries from HEMA even if they are not at the physical store.
                <br>Tracking of customers’ activities in the store via the application is also important in helping understand the tastes of Hema’s customers. Hema can then create tailored recipe recommendations for its customers and find out more ways in which it can satisfy its customers.
